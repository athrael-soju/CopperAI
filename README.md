## üßê Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

It is useful to design and follow a specific format when writing a problem statement. While there are several options
for doing this, the following is a simple and straightforward template often used in Business Analysis to maintain
focus on defining the problem.

- IDEAL: This section is used to describe the desired or ‚Äúto be‚Äù state of the process or product. At large, this section
  should illustrate what the expected environment would look like once the solution is implemented.
- REALITY: This section is used to describe the current or ‚Äúas is‚Äù state of the process or product.
- CONSEQUENCES: This section is used to describe the impacts on the business if the problem is not fixed or improved upon.
  This includes costs associated with loss of money, time, productivity, competitive advantage, and so forth.

Following this format will result in a workable document that can be used to understand the problem and elicit
requirements that will lead to a winning solution.

## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

- What are the dependencies of your project?
- Describe each limitation in detailed but concise terms
- Explain why each limitation exists
- Provide the reasons why each limitation could not be overcome using the method(s) chosen to acquire.
- Assess the impact of each limitation in relation to the overall findings and conclusions of your project, and if
  appropriate, describe how these limitations could point to the need for further research.

## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

Write about what you could not develop during the course of the Hackathon; and about what your project can achieve
in the future.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

WhisperChat is an advanced voice assistant for efficient communication, personalized context-aware interaction, persistent memory, and tailored data interpretation.". Features include:
- Fully voiced, hands free interaction, using the OpenAI whisper API for speech to text, as well as the Google cloud API text to speech.
- Persistent, multi user memory, with the ability to injest and interact with custom documents.
- The ability to adjust its persona and response type based on user profile and professional aptitude.

  ```
- Create API keys for:

  ```
  - OpenAI API key
  - Google Gloud Service Account JSON credentials
  - Pinecone API key
  ```

- Set Environment Variables for each service:

  - Rename frontend/.env.local to frontend/.env and set the values:

  ```
  # OpenAI
  OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
  # Backend
  SERVER_PORT=5000 - Adjust as needed
  SERVER_ADDRESS='http://localhost' - Adjust as needed
  SERVER_MESSAGE_ENDPOINT='/message'
  SERVER_SPEAK_ENDPOINT='/speak'
  SERVER_LOGIN_ENDPOINT='/auth/login'
  SERVER_REGISTER_ENDPOINT='/auth/register'
  SERVER_GUEST_ENDPOINT='/auth/guest'
  AUDIO_DB_SENSITIVITY='-55' - Adjust as needed
  ```

  - Rename backend/.env.local to backend/.env and set values:

  ```
  NODE_ENV="dev"
  SERVER_PORT=5000 - Adjust as needed
  # OpenAI
  OPENAI_ENABLED=true - Setting this to false will respond with a generic message. Used for testing.
  OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
  OPENAI_API_MODEL="gpt-3.5-turbo"
  # Model Load Parameters
  DIRECTIVE_ENABLED=false
  MODEL_DIRECTIVE="directive" - Choose a directive from the list of directives in the backend/src/data folder

  PINECONE_ADDRESS="http://pinecone"
  PINECONE_PORT=4000 - Adjust as needed
  PINECONE_TOPK=5 - Adjust as needed
  PINECONE_THRESHOLD=0.95 - Adjust as needed
  ```

  - If you choose to use Pinecone, Rename pinecone/.env.local to pinecone/.env and set values:

  ```
  # OpenAI
  OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
  # Pinecone Vector Search
  PINECONE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"

  ```

  - Additionally, replace backend/credentials/google.api.local.json with backend/credentials/google.api.json and copy/paste your google cloud JSON credentials there

- Start Mongodb Docker container (if you don't have it installed locally):

  ```
  docker run --name mongodb -d mongo:latest
  ```

- Run npm install in each service folder (frontend, backend, pinecone):

  ```
  cd frontend / backend / pinecone
  npm install
  ```

- Alternatively, you can run them all with Docker (after running npm start once in the frontend to init the env.js file)

  ```
  docker-compose up --build -d using the docker-compose.yml file
  docker-compose up --build -d frontend for frontend only
  docker-compose up --build -d backend for backend only
  docker-compose up --build -d pinecone for pinecone only
  ```

You should be able to access the application at http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port you set in the frontend\.env file)

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

- Once deployed, login as guest, or create a basic account.
  Voice Chat: 
  - Record allows the user to initiate continuous discussion.
  - Pause will pause recording, but pressing Record again will resume it.
  - Stop will stop the ongoing discussion.
  Text Chat:
  - This can be achieved by sending a request to the endpoints directly, via Postman.
  - A sample POST message can be send to localhost:5000/message and contain form-data (username, message) and the response will be returned to the body.
